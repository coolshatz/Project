Sentiment Analysis on Twitter

There are 3 python programs in total. sentiment_mod.py is a sentimental module created for importing and implementing it in various dynaamic scenarios of choice.
Example: We use the sentiment_mod.py to analyse the sentiments of tweets that we get from dat.py which contains four access token keys (consumer key, consumer_secret, access, access secret)  to connect to twitter. 
a.py is python code that is imported by the sentiment_mod.py. Pickled_algos is a folder containing the various data mining algos from nltk corpus.
Short_reviews folder contains the positive.txt and negative.txt to train the models for positive and negative sentiments of the given twitter data.

To execute the project run 'dat.py' for which the tweets alongside the sentiments and several other attributes will be generated as mentioned..
